# Golden Goose Finance App

## Description

For this project, a team of five developers were tasked with building a full stack application. We all agreed on the importance of tracking our finances - total income, spending, bills, and savings - and decided to create an application that allows the user to form effective spending habits. Our solution is Golden Goose Finance, which utilizes React, Apollo, GraphQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node, Express, Material UI, bcrypt, and JWT.

User Story: As a user I want to be able to track my finances in order to gain a better understanding of where my money is going.

## Installation

The first step in installation is to install the React app using `npx create-react-app client`. The user will then enter `npm i` to install dependencies at the root level. The system will then redirect the user into both the client and server sides to install packages and dependencies. Lastly, enter the command `npm run develop` to launch the application in the browser.

Shortcut command: `npm i && npm run develop`

## Usage

The user can click the deployment link below on either desktop or mobile. From the homepage, the user will need to initially create an account and log in. Once logged in, the user can view the features of the app in the photo carousel and their financial data in graph form. Golden Goose Finance has the following features: enter your total income, enter and delete reoccuring bills, enter and delete one-time expenses, enter and delete savings goals.

## Testing

The user can sandbox in Apollo and GraphQL to test queries and mutations. MongoDB Compass can also be used to verify the entering and modifying of data into the database.
